    <div class="text"> "As I bask into the grandeur of all the years that Patriot Siksha Sansthan has been in existence, what comes to my mind is that – “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand ." - <b>Albert Einstein</b> 
    <br> <br>
    It is through education that a child learns to face the challenges of life, yet educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all. In our school we endeavor constantly to instill moral values and principles among students so that they develop into sensitive and responsible citizens. We shall continue with this commitment to the cause of education and the nurturing of impressionable minds of today to make their tomorrow bright and beautiful.

        Education is not just about the subjects that are learnt and taught in school. Becoming educated is not restricted to being in school and then in college, gathering certificates and feeling proud of oneself. It is a lifelong exercise that can be unbelievably exciting if only we wish to jump onto the train of experience and take a trip to every conceivable place on the earth. It is very much apparent that we live today in a world that is so very different from the one we grew up in, the one we were educated in. Change in today’s world is riding an accelerated pace and we need to pause and reflect it on the entire education system. I firmly believe that students must be taught how to think, not what to think.
<br> <br> I believe that good education must focus on all around development of our children having their talent sharping their communication skill & building up their confidence. This is done by in calculating Indian values & traditions through a number of co-curricular activities. This exposing them to our rich Indian culture.
