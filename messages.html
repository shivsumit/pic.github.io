    <img src="img/img21.jpeg"> 
    <div class="text"> Education is not just about the subjects that are learnt and taught in school. Becoming educated is not restricted to being in school and then in college, gathering certificates and feeling proud of oneself. It is a lifelong exercise that can be unbelievably exciting if only we wish to jump onto the train of experience and take a trip to every conceivable place on the earth. It is very much apparent that we live today in a world that is so very different from the one we grew up in, the one we were educated in. Change in todayâ€™s world is riding an accelerated pace and we need to pause and reflect it on the entire education system. I firmly believe that students must be taught how to think, not what to think.
<br> <br> I believe that good education must focus on all around development of our children having their talent sharping their communication skill & building up their confidence. This is done by in calculating Indian values & traditions through a number of co-curricular activities. This exposing them to our rich Indian culture.
